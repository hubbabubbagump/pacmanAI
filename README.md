## Pacman AI Using Deep Neural Networks
Original pacman game taken from https://github.com/greyblue9/pacman-python (by David Reilly and Andy Sommerville)

- Added code from Tensorflow/Tflearn to create a pacman AI
- Uses a DNN with convoluted and fully connected layers to create the model
- Changed the code from python2 to python3
- Fixed some issues with recursion
